Userscripts for Safari by Justin Wasack.

### Installing Userscripts Extension

To get userscripts going in Userscripts, first you have to install it from the [Apple Appstore][appstoreWebsite]. Install it like any other App.

### Installing Userscripts

Once Userscripts is installed, installing userscripts from [OpenUserJS.org][oujs] is simple. Navigate to the OpenUserJS page for the script, then click the blue "Install" button at the top of the page.
You will be directed to a page showing the source code of that script.
Open the Userscripts extension, and click where it says <kbd>Userscript Detected: <u>Click To Install</u></kbd>.

A confirmation dialog box should pop up, showing you details about the script and the websites it can access. Click "Install" if you want to go ahead, and you should get a confirmation that the script has been installed.

Installing userscripts from other sources is a similar process. You just need to find the installation link for the script. This will be a button or link to a file with a name that ends ".user.js"

After installing a userscript, you won't normally notice any further changes until you visit, or refresh, a website that it runs on.

### Managing Userscripts

If you click on the Userscripts Extension logo in the toolbar of safari, there is <kbd>Open Extension Page</kbd> at the buttom of the extension. This will take you to a User Scripts page in USerscripts. 
This lets you enable or disable scripts as well as edit scripts and add new.
